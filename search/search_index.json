The first thing we need to understand is how to convert the application code into something that you can use and install on a system. To complete this challenge, you are required to: Create a GNU/Linux virtual machine. The decision of what distro to use is up to you. For applications with a multitier architecture (e.g., applications where presentation (frontend), processing (backend), and data management (database, cache server, etc), are separated services), you can also choose whether to create one VM for all services or one for each service. If you have a little bit of knowledge on any cloud provider and want to save the time to install and configure a VM, you can also set up an instance there, but keep in mind that it will cost more money. Bonus points: Use Vagrant to set up your VMs. It will serve the purpose of introducing you to the * as code principle, which will become very important in this RampUp and your professional career. Install everything you need to run the application. The application may require some software to be installed in the system to run properly (e.g., to run a Java server application, you will need JRE and an application server such as Tomcat), or maybe you need to run a database system or configure some environment variables. Run the application with best practices. There are many ways to run an application, some of them better suited for testing environments, others for production. Find what are the best practices to do for a production environment . Maybe you need to configure an NGINX server, or use Tomcat, etc. Find what works best for the application you have. Keep in mind what happens if you restart your machine, do you need to start the service manually again or it happens automatically? On which port are you going to expose the application? And remember, everything you do must be done on a terminal! We want you to learn how things work on the inside. Note: Write down every step or command you execute.

But once that product is created, what do we do with it? How do we deliver it to the final client in the fastest and reliable way can? How do we make sure the product we are releasing is not broken or contains bugs? CI We will break the challenges in two parts, the first part will be about continuous integration and the second part about continuous deployment/delivery. In the first part you\u2019ll design and setup your CI pipeline: Design and create a diagram of your continuous integration pipeline. In this stage is very important to internalize the concepts and terminology of CI, so, focus on that instead of searching about tools. Also, don\u2019t think about deployment yet, this will come in a later stage Research and choose an automation server. There is a big list to choose from (Travis, Jenkins, CircleCI, Gitlab, Bamboo, etc). Again, feel free to choose whatever you like the most. Implement the pipeline you created in the tool you chose. If you feel something is not right with your diagram, make the necessary adjustment. CD Hopefully and the end of point 3 you will end up with a fully tested artifact ready to be deployed. Now it\u2019s time to deploy your artifact in your infrastructure: Design and implement your deployment process. Every application is different, so choose the right tools and process to deploy your application in your infrastructure. Choose the policies of when you are going to deploy. For example, you may need to trigger the build process automatically in case there\u2019s a change in a specific branch, or maybe someone needs to press a button, etc. Also, imagine you are part of an organization, who is allowed to deploy? How are you going to enforce that? Research and learn about deployment strategies and choose one to implement your project. Implement your deployment solution.

In a traditional sysadmin world, usually, the configuration of servers (everything the server needs to work) are managed either manually or by a bunch of scripts that automate some processes.

One of the central aspects of success on any DevOps implementation is the management of the source code. Without this, implementing practices like CI/CD would be impossible.

Your goal should be automating almost everything. Every time you make a manual task you need to ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I need to do if I don\u2019t want to do this again\u201d. And to automate we need to know how to code, at least, in one programming language. It\u2019s time to automate everything you did on the first challenge. For this challenge you will be required to: Choose one (or several) programming language(s). You are free to choose the language you like, but also keep in mind there are some languages that are preferred in the Sysadmin world (for example, Emojicode might not be a good choice). There\u2019s no need to stick to a single language, you can use as many as you want. (if you want suggestions, Python has a small learning curve and great scripting capabilities, and Go will give you more powerful features). Create one (or several) script(s) to automate the provisioning for the VM\u2019s that you created. The most important requirement is that for a new fresh VM with nothing else installed, the execution of that script must install and configure everything necessary to run the application. After the script finishes its execution, the application and all its dependencies must be up and running. Note: There\u2019s an alternative to this which we will work on the configuration management challenge. Try to make your scripts as idempotent (term to keep in mind) as you can , that way it doesn\u2019t matter how many times you execute the script, it will only do the necessary steps and nothing more.

Create a diagram that reflects the design of the infrastructure you will create in the next steps. Create the networking infrastructure on which your application will live. Setup a custom VNet. Create the subnets. Configure security for your subnets (Subnet Security Groups). Note: Because of constraints with the training Azure account, you may be required to use an existing networking infrastructure. In that case, explain your tutor each the elements involved and how they relate to each other. Make sure you don\u2019t skip this step; networking is an essential part of what we do! Create the compute infrastructure to support the application. Is recommended to separate front-end and back-end. Create Virtual Machines and install the applications Capture Images that contains the application and configurations. Create an Scale Set Create a LoadBalancer or and Application Gateway (Read about both and understand the differences, explain why you decided to use the one you deploy) Create LoadBalancer between Front-End and Back-End The expected behavior is: If you destroy one instance (or the application fails), another must be created automatically with the application running again. Note: If the application has any external service, like a database or cache system, you can either use a managed service by Azure (as SQL databases, or Azure Database for MySQL, etc.) Or install and manage the service by yourself. In a real production environment, we usually use managed services, but it's a great learning exercise to create all things by yourself. So, if you think you have time, we recommend following the second option, you\u2019ll learn tons of new stuff! Secure your infrastructure. Don\u2019t forget to always follow the principle of least privilege. Create security groups for all your resources (Virtual Machines, DBs, etc.). Decide carefully which ports you open and who can access them. Create Service Principals to assign permissions to the applications.
